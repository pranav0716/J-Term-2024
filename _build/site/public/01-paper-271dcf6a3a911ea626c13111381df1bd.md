## Abstract
+++ ("part": "abtract")
This paper analyzes the cost of a slice of pizza in New York City from 2014 to the present day, visualizing certain trends and patterns through various charts, maps, and graphs. This research proves its relevance, as has implications for culture, economics, urban planning, tourism, and community dynamics. Moreover, this research provides a lens through which to understand and engage with the unique and diverse aspects of New York City's culinary landscape.

## Data Collection

The study utilizes a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2014 to the current year, capturing the location coordinates, prices, and other relevant details of plain pizza slices across NYC. The dataset is segmented to create two distinct visualizations - a geospatial heatmap and a scatter plot representing the averages over the years.

## Data Visualization




The scatter plot showcases the average prices of plain pizza slices from 2014 to the present year. Each point on the plot represents the mean price for a specific year, offering a clear visual representation of the trend in average pricing over time. This analysis aids in identifying overarching patterns and understanding how the average cost of plain pizza slices has fluctuated throughout the study period. We see a notable increase in price after 2020, which [Mishra, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264355) states is a result of supply chain disruptions during COVID, leading to an increase in price of wheat flour, a main ingredient in pizza dough.

These geospatial heatmaps provide a dynamic representation of plain pizza slice prices across different locations in NYC. The slider allows for an exploration of the temporal evolution, offering a nuanced view of how pricing patterns change from year to year. The intensity of color in the heatmap reflects the density of plain pizza slice prices over a decade, showcasing areas of concentration and potential trends.
